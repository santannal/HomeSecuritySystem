# 🏡 Smart Home Project

## 📝 Description

This graduation project is a smart home system developed using Arduino. The system was programmed in C++ and C# with .NET Framework for Windows Forms applications. It includes the following functionalities:

- **Presence Sensor:** Detects movement in the monitored area.
- **Lock with Display and Keyboard:** Controls access with a keyboard and display.
- **Servo Motor:** Operates the door lock.
- **Smoke Sensor:** Monitors for the presence of smoke to detect fires.
- **Temperature Sensor:** Monitors the ambient temperature.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Arduino:** Used to integrate sensors and actuators.
- **C++:** Programming for Arduino.
- **C# and .NET Framework:** Development of the Windows Forms interface.
- **SerialPort Library:** Used for serial communication between the Arduino and the Windows Forms application.

## 🚀 Usage

- Initialize the Arduino system with all sensors and actuators connected.
- Run the Windows Forms application to monitor and control the smart home system.

## 📡 Library Used for Serial Communication

For serial communication between the Arduino and the Windows Forms application, the SerialPort class from the .NET Framework was used. This class facilitates reading and writing data via serial ports.
